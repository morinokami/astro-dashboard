# Astro Dashboard

This project implements the [Dashboard](https://next-learn-dashboard.vercel.sh/) developed in the [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) course using [Astro](https://astro.build/). By leveraging Astro [DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/), [Actions](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/configuration-reference/#experimentalactions), and Suspense (powered by [Simple stream](https://simple-stack.dev/stream)), I aimed to replicate the Next.js version of the dashboard as closely as possible.

You can access the application at https://next-learn-dashboard-astro.vercel.app/. Please log in using the following credentials:

- Email: user@nextmail.com
- Password: 123456

To run the application locally, install [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and execute the following command:

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
```

This will initialize the DB and start the application. You can access the application at http://localhost:4321.
